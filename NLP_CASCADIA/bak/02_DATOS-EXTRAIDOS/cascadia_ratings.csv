6,ourmove123,Mar 2025,"Cascadia has a decent theme that sets a pleasant backdrop for the game.

The dual task of matching land tiles and animal patterns, while straightforward, might lack excitement for some players.

The variations in animal cards (A-B-C-D versions) don't can enhance the game's novelty.

The game does have some luck, but feels quite balanced, and it will rarely feel unfair.

It's an excellent choice for those new to tabletop gaming, offering an accessible entry point.

One of the best abstract games I've played.

The solo mode has no AI opponent, mainly flushes the market every turn, and encourages the player to beat their high score."

The best of this series in my opinion (Verdant, Calico, Cascadia). Abstract strategy game with a quick time to the table and fast teach, but lots of ""thinky"" moments. So well executed and such a beautiful table presence. It is very much a multi-player solo game but paying attention to what other people are doing will help you maximize in areas they are not. Also great conversationally at the table. Appeals to the heavy gamer and the casual gamer alike. Rewards thinky play but ultimately an easy game. Can't recommend enough.

8,ajie426,Mar 2025,"超主观点评（5人局）：
1、这是第二次玩了，第一次玩是1年多前的2023年12月24日（3人），当时觉得可能是期待太高，没有想象中好玩，打了7分。现在发现有扩展了再试试，降低预期后感觉它又行了，以后还可以开。
2、自然地标这个扩展挺不错的，大大增强了相同地形连续摆放的优势，且加入了竞速元素，地标先到先得，且强弱区别很大，先拿的大概率可以拿到加分多的，最后再拿的可能只能加1分。
3、游戏玩法简单，动物主题也很友好，适合推新。同时在简单的机制下，每一个选择都很纠结，老玩家也可以玩得很开心。
小心得：
1、开局就要研究清楚几种动物的算分方式，蛮多动物是可以互相叠加的，考虑清楚自己的主力方向。
2、每种地形都一直连续是不现实的，要有取舍。
玩法：
到自己时选择一组栖息地+其对应的动物，然后把动物放到自己的个人版图中；当有一种地形有5块相连时可以拿一个地标和地标牌，所有板块拿完则游戏结束，对照每种动物的计分规则进行计分。"

4,dennislaumen,Mar 2025,"I've only played this solo, so take all of this with a grain of salt. After playing solo however, I'm pretty sure I'd like this best solo, or maybe as a two player game, but that would really depend on the partner and atmosphere around the session as to be fair. You'd both be playing your own solo game as interaction is extremely limited and mostly accidental.

I really enjoy the drafting of couples of tiles and tokens, and the way this interacts with the tableau building. It's a nice puzzle and is able to straddle the line between challenging and relaxing very well. I also really enjoy the different objective cards, that change up the puzzle every time.

The massive downside being that you're really playing a solo game together. I can't imagine playing this game with 4, it would probably drive me crazy."

Easy to learn, satisfying to get good at. Can easily play a few rounds of this and get lost with some good music, or equally pull up a quick game with a coffee before work.

Some of the cards could have had example scores on to help decipher the rules. A little searching online helped figure out the nuances."

a just chunky enough tile placement game. this one's a two-for-one, too! tiles and chips to place makes this super tactile and puzzley without making me fall victim to analysis paralysis.
that said, i hate scoring this game. subtotals? two numbers per landscape type? and there's how many types? thank god there are apps that score this game for you now because scoring by hand is terrible"

7,m0neypulati0n,Mar 2025,"7.5  Initial rating after 5 games (21/03/2024):
First 2-3 games was interesting and pleasant. After just two more games I'm already growing tired of it. Feels repetitive. Scoring is unimaginative with too little variety. More should've been included in the core box, will have to come up with our own to make it interesting. Rating likely to drop."
