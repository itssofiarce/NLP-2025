Cascadia won the 2022 Spiel des Jahres for German board game of the year!
Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest! In Cascadia, players take turns building their terrain and populating it with wildlife. Players must create a diverse and harmonious ecosystem - each animal species has a different spatial preference and each habitat must be placed to reduce fragmentation and create wildlife corridors. 
Cascadia is a tile and token drafting game for 1-4 players. It involves a dual-layer puzzle that progresses over time as more habitats and wildlife are added to each player’s individual ecosystem. Players score points by creating the most harmonious spatial arrangements of wildlife, and also by creating the largest contiguous habitat corridors.
Cascadia is the second Flatout Games CoLab game - like its predecessor, Calico, it is a puzzly, hex-based tile-laying game with interwoven puzzle elements. Although Cascadia’s rules are as simple as pick one, place one, the game offers multiple layers of modularity and challenging decision-making to keep even the most seasoned gamers coming back for more!
We would like to express our immense gratitude to the backers listed below the images who made Cascadia a success on Kickstarter in Fall 2020!
